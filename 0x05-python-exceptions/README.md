# 0x03. 0x05. Python - Exceptions

### Try - Except - Raise - Finally
<p>
There are two types of syntax and exception errors

###### Types:
* __syntax__ 
Errors where we forget some (comma, colon, etc), the interpreter indicates you with an arrow that the error is in a certain file and close to that line..

* __Except__
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that interrupts the normal flow of program instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot deal with, it generates an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.
