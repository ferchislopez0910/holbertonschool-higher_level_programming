# 0x02. Python - import & modules

### What is a module?
<p>
It is a part of the code, which can be executed, as long as it has been saved and will be useful for future programs.

These files contain definitions in files or scripts, so Python can import them as modules.

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the name of the module with the suffix .py appended.

The module name, which is inside the module, is a global VAR.
